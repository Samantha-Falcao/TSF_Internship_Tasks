# TSF_Internship_Tasks
This repository contains the tasks completed by me during the Data Science and Machine Learning internship at The Sparks Foundation.

### Q1. (To Explore Supervised Machine Learning)
The motive of this task is to explore supervised Machine Learning using Linear Regression. The task is to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to
score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as itinvolves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

### Q2. (To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning)
The motive of this task is to explore Unsupervised Machine Learning using Linear RegressionFrom the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. The dataset can be found and loaded from the inbuilt datasets in seaborn library or skicit learn library. Alternatively, it can also be found at the following link:

### Q3. (To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm )
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. The dataset can be found and loaded from the inbuilt datasets in seaborn library or skicit learn library. Alternatively, it can also be found at the following link:
